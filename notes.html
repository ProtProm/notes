    <h3> 3. HTML markup </h3>
    Markups is made up of tags. For now, there are three types of tags, opening and closing tag (all together is known as element), and the void tag which has no closing tag. Contents can be tags or text.
    <xmp>Element: <otag> contents </ctag>
      <b> bold </b>
      <em> emphasis </em></xmp>

    </p>
    <h3>4. HTML attributes</h3>
    Atributtes are used to refer to values, meaning equal to.
    <xmp><otag attribute = "value"> contents </ctag>
      <a href = "www.google.com"> anchor </a>
      <img src = "url" alt = "text">
         #void tag
  </xmp>
    <h3>5. Whitespace </h3>
    <p>br(break) tag: just ends the line
    <br>p(paragraph) tag: makes an invisible box
    </p>
    <h3>6. Inline and block</h3>
    <p>The difference is between both is in rendering only text or another block.
    </p>
    <p>Inline: a, span, em, br, img, strong
    <br>Block: div, p, form
    </p>
    <h3>7. span and div</h3>
    <p>Just contain their content, and there's a way to attach styles to them for how they display. Class is CSS which is a separate language for styles and looks of documents and texts.
    </p>
    <xmp><span class="foo">
      text
    </span>

    <div class="bar">
      text
    </div></xmp>
